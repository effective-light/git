Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.



Fixes since v2.34
-----------------

 * "git grep" looking in a blob that has non-UTF8 payload was
   completely broken when linked with certain versions of PCREv2
   library in the latest release.

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge edbd9f3715 ab/update-submitting-patches later to maint).

 * "git pull" with any strategy when the other side is behind us
   should succeed as it is a no-op, but doesn't.
